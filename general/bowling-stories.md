# ACME Bowling Platform

We believe that an online platform, dedicated to bowling, where players can keep track of their game history, get statistics and build a community with other bowlers will result in increased sales of ACME products. We will know it is successful when there is a measurable increase in sales within 4 months of the first release

## Game Tracking

If bowlers had a variety of statistical views about their games, they could use that information to identify trends and potential improvements.  This could keep engaged and visiting frequently.

(e.q. Game Avg, # of strikes/game, # of spares/game) 

## Advertising Campaigns

In order to drive new sales to ACME products, we should be able to place ads in the system they allow us to target new and existing customers

## Gear Trends

Users could measure the effects of certain gear if we provide detailed statistics around their game and the equipment they use<Paste>

## Tips and Tricks

In order to discover new strategies and equipment for improving their game, users should be able to find and share tips and tricks in the platform

## Lane Reservations

Bowlers could use the platform to reserve a lane at a particular bowling alley, in order to ensure that a particular time slot is available and to help establish a connection to their favorite locations

## Virtual Leaderboard

In order to keep users on the platform, we can provide a “virtual leaderboard” system where bowlers can compete with other bowlers on various aspects of the game
